# Motivation

Insurance costs, espeically in the United States, are very expensive. I wanted to explore what features contribute to high medical costs such as smoking or weight and by how much they contribute. Moreover, I wanted to strengthen my ability to utilize the scikit toolkit such has pipelines, polynomial features, ect. While the features in this dataset are limited, I was able learn many new concepts in Scikit-learn in modeling and evaluation that I can apply to future projects.
